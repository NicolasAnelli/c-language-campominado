## Prerequisites

For this code, you will need a C language compiler.

## Compiling and running

For running it you need to compile the library and the main source code file of project using the below command:
```

```

This will create a new executable in the project root path named minefield (or minefield.exe on windows). Now you only need to run it:

For Linux/MAC users:

```
./minefield 
```

For Windows users, just double click on executable program.

## How to play

* Other numbers count some points
* If you get no lives the game is ended.
